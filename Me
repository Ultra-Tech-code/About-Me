My name is Adewale Iyanuoluwa Isaac, I'm a web developer. 
I am quality-oriented college student (Bachelor of Science in Computer Science) currently attending University of Ibadan. During the course of my academic career, I also managed to accrue nearly 2 months of work experience. I had the privilege of learning at Start.ng as an Intern in my free time, where I learned valuable professional skills such as Web Design and Python. I am also through with the HTML, CSS and Javascript fundamental course on Sololearn. I did a course on AI titled “AI demystified: 5 day mini course” organized by Infinite Red Academy. I have successfully completed the freecodecamp.org “Responsive Web Design” and "JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structure" developer certification. My latest certification is by SideHustle on Frontend Development (React JS) which was completed on December 2021.
In both my academic and professional life, I have been consistently praised as focused by my parents and peers. Whether working on academic, extra-curricular, or professional projects, I apply proven analytical, multitasking, and teamwork skills, which I hope to leverage in the Internship at your organization.
